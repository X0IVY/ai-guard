## ⚠️ PLEASE DON'T CREATE PUBLIC SECURITY ISSUES

if you found a security vulnerability, please DON'T report it here as a public issue.

### how to report security issues

1. **preferred**: use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
   - go to the Security tab
   - click "Report a vulnerability"
   - fill out the private report form

2. **alternative**: check SECURITY.md for email contact

### why private reporting?

- public disclosure gives attackers a head start
- i need time to fix the issue before it's public
- responsible disclosure protects users

### what happens after you report?

- i'll acknowledge within 48 hours
- we'll work together on a fix
- you'll get credit in the security advisory (if you want)
- fix will be released asap

thanks for helping keep this project secure! 🔒
